# blender_dynamic_pie_menu
A research experiment for creating more complex dynamic spacebar pie menus for Blender. Inspired by the dynamic space bar menu that comes with blender, this tries to do something similar but using the pie menu.

# how to install
On OSX:
- right click on Blender App and select "show contents"
- navigate to a folder similar to "Applications/Blender/Contents/Resources/2.77/scripts/addons"
- create a folder in the "addons" folder with a name such as "DomsDynamicSpacebarPie"
- copy the "icons" folder into that and the "__init__.py" file - which is the script itself
